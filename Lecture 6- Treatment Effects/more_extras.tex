\begin{frame}{Further approaches to evaluation of program effects: \\
{\small Difference in Differences } }
\begin{itemize}
\item Sometimes we may feel we can impose more structure on the problem.
\item Suppose in particular that we can write the outcome equation as
\begin{align*}
 Y_{it} =\alpha_i +d_t +\beta_i T_{it} +u_{it}
 \end{align*}
\item In the above we have now introduced a time dimension $t=\{1,2\}$. 
\item Now suppose that $T_{i1}=0$ for all $i$ and $T_{i2}=1$ for a well defined group of individuals in our population.
\item This framework allows us to identify the ATT effect under the assumption that the growth of the outcome in the non-treatment state is independent of treatment allocation:
\begin{align*}
E[Y_{i2}^0 - Y_{i1}^0 | T] = E[Y_{i2}^0 - Y_{i1}^0] 
\end{align*}
\item This is known as \alert{parallel trends}.
\end{itemize}
\end{frame}

\begin{frame}{Before and After} 
An even simpler estimator is the \alert{before and after} or \alert{event study}.
\begin{itemize}
\item We look an outcome before or after an event
\begin{itemize}
\item A news event: the announcement of a merger or stock split.
\item A tax change, a new law, etc.
\end{itemize}
\begin{align*}
E[Y_{i2} - Y_{i1} | T_{i2}=1] & = E[Y_{i2}^1 - Y_{i1}^1 | T_{i2}=1] \\
 &= d_2-d_1 + E[\beta_{i}| T_{i2}=1] 
\end{align*}
\item Except under strong conditions $d_2 = d_1$ we shouldn't believe the results of the before and after estimator.
\item Main Problem: we attribute changes to treatment that might have happened anyway \alert{trend}.
\item e.g: Cigarette consumption drops 4\% after a tax hike. (But it dropped 3\% the previous four years).
\item Also worry about: \alert{anticipation}, \alert{gradual rollout}, etc.
\end{itemize}
\end{frame}

\begin{frame}{Difference in Differences} 
Let's try and estimate $d_2- d_1$ directly and then difference it out. Here we use \alert{parallel trends}:
\begin{align*}
E[Y_{i2}^0 - Y_{i1}^0 | T_{i2}=1]  &= E[Y_{i2}^0 - Y_{i1}^0 | T_{i2}=0] \\
E[Y_{i2} - Y_{i1} | T_{i2}=0] & = d_2-d_1
\end{align*}
We now obtain an estimator for ATT:
\begin{align*}
E[\beta_{i}| T_{i2}=1]  = E[Y_{i2} - Y_{i1} | T_{i2}=1] - E[Y_{i2} - Y_{i1} | T_{i2}=0]  
\end{align*}
which can be estimated by the difference in the growth between the treatment and the control group.
\end{frame}

\begin{frame}{Parallel Trends}
\begin{figure}

\includegraphics[width=3.5in]{./resources/parallel-trends}
\end{figure}
\end{frame}

\begin{frame}{Difference in Differences}
Now consider the following problem:
\begin{itemize}
\item Suppose we wish to evaluate a training program for those with low
earnings. Let the threshold for eligibility be $B$.
\item We have a panel of individuals and those with low earnings qualify for
training, forming the treatment group.
\item Those with higher earnings form the control group. 
\item Now the low earning group is low for two reasons
\begin{enumerate}
\item They have low permanent earnings ($\alpha_i$ is low) - this is accounted for by diff in diffs.
\item They have a negative transitory shock ($u_{i1}$ is low) - this is not accounted for by diff in diffs.
\end{enumerate} 
\end{itemize}
\end{frame} 

\begin{frame}{Difference in Differences}
\begin{itemize}
\item  \#2 above violates the assumption {\small $E[Y_{i2}^0 - Y_{i1}^0 | T] = E[Y_{i2}^0 - Y_{i1}^0]$}. 
\item To see why note that those participating into the program are such
that {\small $Y_{i0}^0 < B$}. Assume for simplicity that the shocks {\small $u$} are {\small $iid$}. Hence {\small $u_{i1} < B- \alpha_i - d_1$}. 
This implies: 
{\small $$E[Y_{i2}^0 - Y_{i1}^0 | T=1] = d_2 = d_1 - E[u_{i1}| u_{i1} <  B-\alpha_i - d_1]$$}
For the control group:
{\small $$E[Y_{i2}^0 - Y_{i1}^0 | T=1] = d_2 = d_1 - E[u_{i1}| u_{i1} >  B-\alpha_i - d_1]$$}
\item Hence
\begin{align*}
& E[Y_{i2}^0 - Y_{i1}^0 | T=1] - E[Y_{i2}^0 - Y_{i1}^0 | T=0] =\\
&  E[u_{i1} | u_{i1} >  B-\alpha_i - d_1] - E[u_{i1} | u_{i1} < B-\alpha_i - d_1]  >0
  \end{align*}
 \item This is effectively regression to the mean: those unlucky enough to have a bad shock recover and show greater growth relative to those with a good shock. The nature of the bias depends on the stochastic properties of the shocks and how individuals select into training.
\end{itemize}
\end{frame} 

\begin{frame}{Difference in Differences}
Ashefelter (1978) was one of the first to consider difference in differences to evaluate training programs.

\begin{frame}{Difference in Differences}
Ashenfelter (1978) reports the following results.
\begin{figure}
\centering
\includegraphics[scale=.85]{./resources/ashefelter2.pdf}
\end{figure}
\end{frame}

\begin{frame}{Difference in Differences}
\begin{itemize}
\item The assumption on growth of the non-treatment outcome being independent of assignment to treatment may be violated, but it may still be true conditional on $X$.
\item Consider the assumption
$$ E[Y_{i2}^0- Y_{i1}^0 | X,T] = E[Y_{i2}^0- Y_{i1}^0 | X] $$ 
\item This is just matching assumption on a redefined variable, namely the growth in the outcomes. In its simplest form the approach is implemented by running the regression
$$ Y_{it} = \alpha_i + d_t + \beta_i T_{it} + \gamma_t' X_i + u_{it}$$ 
which allows for differential trends in the non-treatment growth depending on $X_i$. More generally one can implement propensity score matching on the growth of outcome variable when panel data is available.
\end{itemize}
\end{frame}

\begin{frame}{Difference in Differences with Repeated Cross Sections}
\begin{itemize}
\item Suppose we do not have available panel data but just a random sample from the relevant population in a pre-treatment and a post-treatment period. We can still use difference in differences.
\item First consider a simple case where {\small $E[Y_{i2}^0- Y_{i1}^0 | T] = E[Y_{i2}^0- Y_{i1}^0]$}.
\item We need to modify slightly the assumption to
\vspace{-.5pc}
\begin{align*}
E[Y_{i2}^0| \text{\tiny Group receiving training}]&-E[Y_{i1}^0| \text{\tiny Group receiving training in the next period}] \\
&= E[Y_{i2}^0-Y_{i1}^0]  
\end{align*}
which requires, in addition to the original independence
assumption that conditioned on particular individuals that population we will be sampling from does not change composition.
\item We can then obtain immediately an estimator for ATT as
\begin{align*}
&E[\beta_i |T_{i2}=1] \\ 
&= E[Y_{i2}| \text{\tiny Group receiving training}]-E[Y_{i1}| \text{\tiny Group receiving training next period}] \\
&- \{E[Y_{i2} | \text{\tiny Non-trainees}] - E[Y_{i1} | \text{\tiny Group not receiving training next period}]\}
\end{align*}
\end{itemize}
\end{frame}


\begin{frame}{Difference in Differences with Repeated Cross Sections}
\begin{itemize}
\item More generalIy we need an assumption of conditional independence of the form
\begin{align*}
E[Y_{i2}^0 & | X, \text{\tiny Group receiving training}]-E[Y_{i1}^0| X, \text{\tiny Group receiving training next period}] \\
&= E[Y_{i2}^0 | X] - E[Y_{i1}^0 |X]
\end{align*}
\item Under this assumption (and some auxiliary parametric assumptions) we can obtain an estimate of the effect of treatment on the treated by the regression
\begin{align*}
Y_{it} = \alpha_g + d_t + \beta T_{it} + \gamma' X_{it} + u_{it}
\end{align*} 
\end{itemize}
\end{frame}

\begin{frame}{Difference in Differences with Repeated Cross Sections}
\begin{itemize}
\item More generalIy we can first run the regression 
\begin{align*}
Y_{it} = \alpha_g + d_t + \beta (X_{it}) T_{it} + \gamma' X_{it} + u_{it}
\end{align*} 
where $\alpha_g$ is a dummy for the treatment of comparison group, and $\beta (X_{it})$ can be parameterized as $\beta(X_{it}) = \beta' X_{it}$. The ATT can then be estimated as the average of $\beta' X_{it}$ over the (empirical) distribution of $X$.
\item A non parametric alternative is offered by Blundell, Dias, Meghir and van Reenen (2004).
\end{itemize}
\end{frame}

\begin{frame}{Difference in Differences and Selection on Unobservables}
\begin{itemize}
\item Suppose we relax the assumption of \emph{no selection} on unobservables. 
\item Instead we can start by assuming that
\begin{align*}
E[Y_{i2}^0 | X,Z] - E[Y_{i1}^0 | X,Z] = E[Y_{i2}^0 | X] - E[Y_{i1}^0 | X]
\end{align*} 
where $Z$ is an instrument which determines training eligibility say but does not determine outcomes in the non-training state. Take $Z$ as binary (1,0).
\item Non-Compliance: not all members of the eligible group ($Z = 1$) will take up training and some of those ineligible ($Z = 0$) may obtain training by other means.
\item A difference in differences approach based on grouping by $Z$ will estimate the impact of being allocated to the eligible group, but not the impact of training itself.
\end{itemize}
\end{frame}

\begin{frame}{Difference in Differences and Selection on Unobservables}
\begin{itemize}
\item Now suppose we still wish to estimate the impact of training on those being trained (rather than just the effect of being eligible)
\item This becomes an IV problem and following up from the discussion of LATE we need stronger assumptions
\begin{itemize}
\item  Independence: for $Z = a, \left\{Y_{i2}^0 - Y_{i1}^0, Y_{i2}^1 - Y_{i1}^1, T(Z=a)\right\}$ is independent of Z.
\item Monotonicity $T_i(1) \ge T_i(0) \, \forall \, i$
\end{itemize}
\item In this case LATE is defined by
 $$\left [E(\Delta Y | Z = 1) - E(\Delta Y | Z = 0)] / [Pr(T(1) = 1) - Pr(T(0) = 1) \right]$$
assuming that the probability of training in the first period is zero.
\end{itemize}              
\end{frame}

\section*{RDD}
\begin{frame}{Regression Discontinuity Design}
\begin{itemize}
\item Another popular research design is the \alert{Regression Discontinuity Design}.
\item In some sense this is a special case of IV regression. (RDD estimates a LATE).
\item Most of this is taken from the JEL Paper by Lee and Lemieux (2010).
\end{itemize}              
\end{frame}

\begin{frame}{RDD: Basics}
\begin{itemize}
\item We have a \alert{running or forcing variable} $x$ such that 
\begin{eqnarray*}
\lim_{x\rightarrow c^{+}} P(T_i | X_i = x) \neq \lim_{x\rightarrow c^{-}}P(T_i | X_i = x)
\end{eqnarray*}
\item The idea is that there is a \alert{discontinuous jump} in the \alert{probability of being treated}.
\item For now we focus on the \alert{sharp discontinuity}:\\
 $P(T_i | X_i \geq c) =1$ and $P(T_i | X_i < c) =0$
 \item There is no single $x$ for which we observe treatment and control. (Compare to Propensity Score!).
\item The most important assumption is that of \alert{no manipulability} $\tau_i \perp D_i$ in some neighborhood of $c$.
\item Example: a social program is available to people who earned less than \$25,000.
\begin{itemize}              
\item If we could compare people earning \$24,999 to people earning \$25,001 we would have as-if random assignment. (MAYBE)
\item But we might not have that many people...
\end{itemize}
\end{itemize}              
\end{frame}

\end{frame}


\begin{frame}{RDD: Sharp RD Case}
RDD uses a set of assumptions distinct from our LATE/IV assumptions. Instead it depends on \alert{continuity}.
\begin{itemize}
\item We need that $E[Y^{(1)} | X]$ and $E[Y^{(0)} | X]$ both be continuous at $X=c$.
\item People just to the left of $c$ are a valid control for those just to the right of $c$.
\item \alert{This is not a testable assumption} $\rightarrow$ draw pictures!
\item We could run the regression where $D_i = \mathbf{1}[X_i > c]$.
\begin{eqnarray*}
Y_i = \beta_0 + \tau D_i + X_i \beta + \epsilon_i
\end{eqnarray*}
\item This puts a lot of restrictions (linearity) on the relationship between $Y$ and $X$.
\item Also (without additional assumptions) we only learn about $\tau_i$ at the point $X=c$.
\end{itemize}
\end{frame}


\begin{frame}{RDD: Nonlinearity}
First thing to relax is assumption of linearity.
\begin{eqnarray*}
Y_i = f(x_i) + \tau D_i  + \epsilon_i
\end{eqnarray*}
This is known as \alert{partially linear model}.
\begin{itemize}
\item Two options for $f(x_i)$:
\begin{enumerate}
\item Kernels: Local Linear Regression
\item Polynomials: $Y_i = \beta_0 + \beta_1 x_i + \beta_2 x_i^2 + \cdots + \beta_p x^p + \tau D_i + \epsilon_i$.
\begin{itemize}
\item Actually, people suggest different polynomials on each side of cutoff! (Interact everything with $D_i$).
\end{itemize}
\end{enumerate}
\item Same objective. Want to flexibly capture what happens on both sides of cutoff.
\item Otherwise risk confusing nonlinearity with discontinuity!
\end{itemize}
\end{frame}
	
\begin{frame}{RDD: Kernel Boundary Problem}
\begin{center}
\includegraphics[width=4.5in]{./resources/ll-fig2}

\end{frame}

\begin{frame}{RDD: Polynomial Implementation Details}
To make life easier:
\begin{itemize}
\item replace $\tilde{x}_i = x_i - c$.
\item Estimate coefficients $\beta$: $(1, \tilde{x}, \tilde{x}^2, \ldots, \tilde{x}^p)$ and\\
 $\tilde{\beta}$: $(D_i, D_i \tilde{x},D_i \tilde{x}^2, \ldots, D_i \tilde{x}^p)$.
 \item Now treatment effect at $c$ just the coefficient on $D_i$. (We can ignore the interaction terms).
 \item If we want treatment effect at $x_i > c$ then we have to account for interactions.
 \begin{itemize}
 \item Identification away from $c$ is somewhat dubious.
\end{itemize}
\item Lee and Lemieux (2010) suggest estimating a coefficient on a dummy for each bin in the polynomial regression $\sum_{k} \phi_k B_k$.
 \begin{itemize}
 \item Add polynomials until you can satisfy the test that the joint hypothesis test that $\phi_1 = \cdots \phi_k= 0$.
\item There are better ways to choose polynomial order...
\end{itemize}
\end{itemize}
\end{frame}

	
\begin{frame}{RDD: Checklist}
Most RDD papers follow the same formula (so should yours)
\begin{itemize}
\item Plot of $P(D | X)$ so that we can see the discontinuity
\item Plot of $E[Y | X]$ so that we see discontinuity there also
\item Plot of $E[W | X ]$ so that we don't see a discontinuity in controls.
\item Density of $X$ (check for manipulation).
\item Show robustness to different ``windows''
\item The OLS RDD estimates
\item The Local Linear RDD estimates
\item The polynomial (from each side) RDD estimates
\item An f-test of ``bins'' showing that the polynomial is flexible enough.
\end{itemize}
Read Lee and Lemieux (2010) before you get started.

\begin{frame}{Other Examples}
Luca on Yelp
\begin{itemize}
\item Have data on restaurant revenues and yelp ratings.
\item Yelp produces a yelp score (weighted average rating) to two decimals ie: $4.32$.
\item Score gets rounded to nearest half star
\item Compare $4.24$ to $4.26$ to see the impact of an extra half star.
\item Now there are multiple discontinuities: Pool them? Estimate multiple effects?
\end{itemize}
\end{frame}

\begin{frame}{Fuzzy RD}
An important extension in the \alert{Fuzzy RD}.   Back to where we started:
\begin{eqnarray*}
\lim_{x\rightarrow c^{+}} P(T_i | X_i = x) \neq \lim_{x\rightarrow c^{-}}P(T_i | X_i = x)
\end{eqnarray*}
\begin{itemize}
\item We need a discontinuous jump in probability of treatment, but it doesn't need to be $0 \rightarrow 1$.
\begin{eqnarray*}
\tau_i(c) = \frac{\lim_{x\rightarrow c^{+}} P(Y_i | X_i = x) - \lim_{x\rightarrow c^{-}}P(Y_i | X_i = x)}{\lim_{x\rightarrow c^{+}} P(T_i | X_i = x) - \lim_{x\rightarrow c^{-}}P(T_i | X_i = x)}
\end{eqnarray*}
\item Under sharp RD everyone was a \alert{complier}, now we have some \alert{always takers} and some \alert{never takers} too.
\item Now we are estimating the treatment effect only for the population of compliers at $x=c$.
\item This should start to look familiar. We are going to do IV!
\end{itemize}
\end{frame}

\begin{frame}{Related Idea: Kinks}
 A related idea is that of \alert{kinks}. 
\begin{itemize}
\item Instead of a discontinuous jump in the outcome there is a discontinuous jump in $\beta_i$ on $x_i$.
\item Often things like tax schedules or government benefits have a kinked pattern.
\end{itemize}
\end{frame}

\begin{frame}{One quantity to rule them all: MTE}
Heckman and Vytlacil provide a unifying non-parametric framework to categorize treatment effects. Their approach is known as the \alert{marginal treatment effect} or MTE
\begin{itemize}
\item The MTE isn't a number it is a \alert{function}.
\item All of the other objects (LATE, ATE, ATT, etc.) can be written as integrals (weighted averages) of the MTE.
\item The idea is to bridge the treatment effect parameters (stuff we get from running regressions) and the structural parameters: features of $f(\beta_i)$.
\end{itemize}
\end{frame}

\begin{frame}{One quantity to rule them all: MTE}
\begin{itemize}
\item Consider a treatment effect $\beta_i = Y_{i}(1) - Y_{i}(0)$.
\item Think about a single-index such that $T_i = 1(v_i \leq Z_i' \gamma)$.
\item Think about the person for whom $v_i = Z_i'\gamma$ (just barely untreated).
\begin{eqnarray*}
\Delta^{MTE}(X_i, v_i) = E[\beta_i | X_i, v_i = Z_i'\gamma] 
\end{eqnarray*}
\item MTE is average impact of receiving a treatment for everyone with the same $Z' \gamma$.
\item For any single index model we can rewrite 
\begin{eqnarray*}
T_i = 1(v_i \leq Z_i' \gamma) = 1(u_{is} \leq F(Z_i' \gamma)) \mbox{ for }  u_s \in [0,1]
\end{eqnarray*}
\item $F$ is just the cdf of $v_i$
\item Now we can write $P(Z) = Pr(T=1|Z )= F(Z'\gamma)$.
\end{itemize}
\end{frame}

\begin{frame}
\frametitle{MTE: Derivation}
Now we can write,
\begin{eqnarray*}
Y_0 &=& \gamma_0' X + U_0\\
Y_1 &=& \gamma_1' X + U_1\\
\end{eqnarray*}
$P(T=1 | Z) = P(Z)$ works as our instrument with two assumptions:
\begin{enumerate}
\item $(U_0, U_1, u_s) \perp P(Z) | X$. (Exogeneity)
\item Conditional on $X$ there is enough variation in $Z$ for $P(Z)$ to take on all values $\in(0,1)$.
\begin{itemize}
\item This is much stronger than typical \alert{relevance} condition. Much more like the \alert{special regressor} method we will discus next time.
\end{itemize}
\end{enumerate}
\end{frame}

\begin{frame}
\frametitle{MTE: Derivation}
\footnotesize
Now we can write,
\begin{eqnarray*}
Y &=& \gamma_0' X + T(\gamma_1 - \gamma_0)' X + U_0 + T(U_1 - U_0)\\
E[Y| X,P(Z)=p] &=& \gamma_0' X + p(\gamma_1 - \gamma_0)'X + E[T(U_1 - U_0)|X,P(Z)=p]
\end{eqnarray*}
Observe $T=1$ over the interval $u_s = [0,p]$ and zero for higher values of $u_s$. Let $U_1-U_0 \equiv \eta$.
\begin{eqnarray*}
E[T(U_1 - U_0) | P(Z) =p,X] &=& \int_{-\infty}^{\infty} \int_{0}^{p} (U_1 - U_0) f((U_1-U_0) | U_s = u_s) d u_s d(U_1 -U_0)\\
E[T(\eta) | P(Z) =p,X] &=& \int_{-\infty}^{\infty} \int_{0}^{p} \eta f(\eta | U_s = u_s)  d\, \eta d\, u_s\\
\end{eqnarray*}
\begin{eqnarray*}
\Delta^{MTE}(p) &=& \frac{\partial E[Y | X, P(Z)=p]}{\partial p} = (\gamma_1 - \gamma_0)'X + \int_{-\infty}^{\infty} \eta f(\eta | U_s =p) d\, \eta\\
&=& (\gamma_1 - \gamma_0)'X + E[\eta | u_s =p]
\end{eqnarray*}
What is $E[\eta | u_s =p]$? The expected unobserved gain from treatment of those people who are on the treatment/no-treatment margin $P(Z)=p$.
\end{frame}

\begin{frame}
\frametitle{How to Estimate an MTE}
Easy
\begin{enumerate}
\item Estimate $P(Z) = Pr(T=1 | Z)$ nonparametrically (include exogenous part of $X$ in $Z$).
\item Nonparametric regression of $Y$ on $X$ and $P(Z)$ (polynomials?)
\item Differentiate w.r.t. $P(Z)$
\item plot it for all values of $P(Z)=p$.
\end{enumerate}
So long as $P(Z)$ covers $(0,1)$ then we can trace out the full distribution of $\Delta^{MTE}(p)$.
\end{frame}



\begin{frame}
\footnotesize
\frametitle{Everything is an MTE}
Calculate the outcome given $(X,Z)$ (actually $X$ and $P(Z)=p$).
\begin{itemize}
\item ATE : This one is obvious. We treat everyone!
\begin{eqnarray*}
\int_{-\infty}^{\infty} \Delta^{MTE}(p) = (\gamma_1 - \gamma_0)'X + \underbrace{\int_{-\infty}^{\infty} E(\eta | u_s) d\, u_s}_{0}
\end{eqnarray*}
\item LATE: Fix an $X$ and $P(Z)$ varies from $b(X)$ to $a(X)$ and we integrated over the area between (compliers).
\begin{eqnarray*}
LATE(X)=\int_{-\infty}^{\infty} \Delta^{MTE}(p) =  (\gamma_1 - \gamma_0)'X + \frac{1}{a(X)-b(X)} \int_{b(X)}^{a(X)} E(\eta | u_s) d\, u_s
\end{eqnarray*}

\item ATT 
\begin{eqnarray*}
TT(X)=\int_{-\infty}^{\infty} \Delta^{MTE}(p) \frac{Pr(P(Z | X) > p)}{E[P(Z | X)]} d\,p
\end{eqnarray*}

\item Weights for IV and OLS are a bit more complicated. See the Heckman and Vytlacil paper(s).

\frametitle{Diversion Example}
I have done some work trying to bring these methods into merger analysis.
\begin{itemize}
\item Key quantity: \alert{Diversion Ratio} as I raise my price, how much do people switch to a particular competitor's product
\begin{eqnarray*}
D_{jk}(p_j,p_{-j}) = \left| \frac{\partial q_k}{\partial p_j}(p_j,p_{-j}) /  \frac{\partial q_j}{\partial p_j}(p_j,p_{-j}) \right|
\end{eqnarray*}
\item We hold $p_{-j}$ fixed and trace out $D_{jk}(p_j)$.
\item The \alert{treatment} is leaving good $j$.
\item The $Y_i$ is increased sales of good $k$.
\item The $Z_i$ is the price of good $j$.
\item The key is that all changes in sales of $k$ come through people leaving good $j$ (no direct effects).
\end{itemize}

\frametitle{Diversion Example}
\begin{eqnarray*}
\label{weighteddiversion}
\widehat{D_{jk}^{LATE} }&=& \frac{1}{\Delta q_j} \int_{p_j^{0}}^{p_j^{0}+\Delta p_j} \underbrace{\frac{\partial q_k(p_j,p^{0}_{-j})}{\partial q_j}}_{\equiv D_{jk}(p_j,p^{0}_{-j})} \left| \frac{\partial q_j(p_j,p^{0}_{-j})}{\partial p_j} \right|\, dp_j
\end{eqnarray*}
\begin{itemize}
\item $D_{jk}(p_j,p^{0}_{-j})$ is the MTE.
\item Weights $w(p_j) = \frac{1}{\Delta q_j} \frac{\partial q_j(p_j,p^{0}_{-j})}{\partial p_j}$ correspond to the lost sales of $j$ at a particular $p_j$ as a fraction of all lost sales.
\item When is $LATE \approx ATE$? 
\begin{itemize}
\item Demand for Prius is steep: everyone leaves right away
\item $D_{j,k}(p_j)$ is relatively flat.
\item We might want to think about raising the price to choke price (or eliminating the product from the consumers choice set) same as treating everyone!
\end{itemize}
\end{itemize}

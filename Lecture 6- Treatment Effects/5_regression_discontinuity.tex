\begin{frame}{Regression Discontinuity Design}
\begin{itemize}
\item Another popular research design is the \alert{Regression Discontinuity Design}.
\item In some sense this is a special case of IV regression. (RDD estimates a LATE).
\item Most of this is taken from the JEL Paper by Lee and Lemieux (2010).
\end{itemize}              
\end{frame}

\begin{frame}{RDD: Basics}
\begin{itemize}
\item We have a \alert{running or forcing variable} $x$ such that 
\begin{eqnarray*}
\lim_{x\rightarrow c^{+}} P(T_i | X_i = x) \neq \lim_{x\rightarrow c^{-}}P(T_i | X_i = x)
\end{eqnarray*}
\item The idea is that there is a \alert{discontinuous jump} in the \alert{probability of being treated}.
\item For now we focus on the \alert{sharp discontinuity}:\\
 $P(T_i | X_i \geq c) =1$ and $P(T_i | X_i < c) =0$
 \item There is no single $x$ for which we observe treatment and control. (Compare to Propensity Score!).
\item The most important assumption is that of \alert{no manipulability} $\tau_i \perp D_i$ in some neighborhood of $c$.
\item Example: a social program is available to people who earned less than \$25,000.
\begin{itemize}              
\item If we could compare people earning \$24,999 to people earning \$25,001 we would have as-if random assignment. (MAYBE)
\item But we might not have that many people...
\end{itemize}
\end{itemize}

\begin{frame}{RDD: Sharp RD Case}
RDD uses a set of assumptions distinct from our LATE/IV assumptions. Instead it depends on \alert{continuity}.
\begin{itemize}
\item We need that $E[Y^{(1)} | X]$ and $E[Y^{(0)} | X]$ both be continuous at $X=c$.
\item People just to the left of $c$ are a valid control for those just to the right of $c$.
\item \alert{This is not a testable assumption} $\rightarrow$ draw pictures!
\item We could run the regression where $D_i = \mathbf{1}[X_i > c]$.
\begin{eqnarray*}
Y_i = \beta_0 + \tau D_i + X_i \beta + \epsilon_i
\end{eqnarray*}
\item This puts a lot of restrictions (linearity) on the relationship between $Y$ and $X$.
\item Also (without additional assumptions) we only learn about $\tau_i$ at the point $X=c$.
\end{itemize}
\end{frame}


\begin{frame}{RDD: Nonlinearity}
First thing to relax is assumption of linearity.
\begin{eqnarray*}
Y_i = f(x_i) + \tau D_i  + \epsilon_i
\end{eqnarray*}
This is known as \alert{partially linear model}.
\begin{itemize}
\item Two options for $f(x_i)$:
\begin{enumerate}
\item Kernels: Local Linear Regression
\item Polynomials: $Y_i = \beta_0 + \beta_1 x_i + \beta_2 x_i^2 + \cdots + \beta_p x^p + \tau D_i + \epsilon_i$.
\begin{itemize}
\item Actually, people suggest different polynomials on each side of cutoff! (Interact everything with $D_i$).
\end{itemize}
\end{enumerate}
\item Same objective. Want to flexibly capture what happens on both sides of cutoff.
\item Otherwise risk confusing nonlinearity with discontinuity!
\end{itemize}
\end{frame}

\begin{frame}{RDD: Polynomial Implementation Details}
To make life easier:
\begin{itemize}
\item replace $\tilde{x}_i = x_i - c$.
\item Estimate coefficients $\beta$: $(1, \tilde{x}, \tilde{x}^2, \ldots, \tilde{x}^p)$ and\\
 $\tilde{\beta}$: $(D_i, D_i \tilde{x},D_i \tilde{x}^2, \ldots, D_i \tilde{x}^p)$.
 \item Now treatment effect at $c$ just the coefficient on $D_i$. (We can ignore the interaction terms).
 \item If we want treatment effect at $x_i > c$ then we have to account for interactions.
 \begin{itemize}
 \item Identification away from $c$ is somewhat dubious.
\end{itemize}
\item Lee and Lemieux (2010) suggest estimating a coefficient on a dummy for each bin in the polynomial regression $\sum_{k} \phi_k B_k$.
 \begin{itemize}
 \item Add polynomials until you can satisfy the test that the joint hypothesis test that $\phi_1 = \cdots \phi_k= 0$.
\item There are better ways to choose polynomial order...
\end{itemize}
\end{itemize}
\end{frame}

	
\begin{frame}{RDD: Checklist}
Most RDD papers follow the same formula (so should yours)
\begin{itemize}
\item Plot of $P(D | X)$ so that we can see the discontinuity
\item Plot of $E[Y | X]$ so that we see discontinuity there also
\item Plot of $E[W | X ]$ so that we don't see a discontinuity in controls.
\item Density of $X$ (check for manipulation).
\item Show robustness to different ``windows''
\item The OLS RDD estimates
\item The Local Linear RDD estimates
\item The polynomial (from each side) RDD estimates
\item An f-test of ``bins'' showing that the polynomial is flexible enough.
\end{itemize}
Read Lee and Lemieux (2010) before you get started.

\begin{frame}{Application: Lee (2008)}
Looked at incumbency advantage in the US House of Representatives
\begin{itemize}
\item Running variable was vote share in previous election
\begin{itemize}
\item Problem of naive approach: good candidates get lots of votes!
\item Compare outcomes of districts with barely $D$ to barely $R$.
\end{itemize}
\item First we plot bin-scatter plots and quartic (from each side) polynomials.
\item Discussion about how to choose bin-scatter bandwidth (CV).
\end{itemize}

\begin{frame}{Other Examples}
Luca on Yelp
\begin{itemize}
\item Have data on restaurant revenues and yelp ratings.
\item Yelp produces a yelp score (weighted average rating) to two decimals ie: $4.32$.
\item Score gets rounded to nearest half star
\item Compare $4.24$ to $4.26$ to see the impact of an extra half star.
\item Now there are multiple discontinuities: Pool them? Estimate multiple effects?
\end{itemize}
\end{frame}

\begin{frame}{Fuzzy RD}
An important extension in the \alert{Fuzzy RD}.   Back to where we started:
\begin{eqnarray*}
\lim_{x\rightarrow c^{+}} P(T_i | X_i = x) \neq \lim_{x\rightarrow c^{-}}P(T_i | X_i = x)
\end{eqnarray*}
\begin{itemize}
\item We need a discontinuous jump in probability of treatment, but it doesn't need to be $0 \rightarrow 1$.
\begin{eqnarray*}
\tau_i(c) = \frac{\lim_{x\rightarrow c^{+}} P(Y_i | X_i = x) - \lim_{x\rightarrow c^{-}}P(Y_i | X_i = x)}{\lim_{x\rightarrow c^{+}} P(T_i | X_i = x) - \lim_{x\rightarrow c^{-}}P(T_i | X_i = x)}
\end{eqnarray*}
\item Under sharp RD everyone was a \alert{complier}, now we have some \alert{always takers} and some \alert{never takers} too.
\item Now we are estimating the treatment effect only for the population of compliers at $x=c$.
\item This should start to look familiar. We are going to do IV!
\end{itemize}
\end{frame}

\begin{frame}{Related Idea: Kinks}
 A related idea is that of \alert{kinks}. 
\begin{itemize}
\item Instead of a discontinuous jump in the outcome there is a discontinuous jump in $\beta_i$ on $x_i$.
\item Often things like tax schedules or government benefits have a kinked pattern.
\end{itemize}
\end{frame}

\begin{frame}{One quantity to rule them all: MTE}
Heckman and Vytlacil provide a unifying non-parametric framework to categorize treatment effects. Their approach is known as the \alert{marginal treatment effect} or MTE
\begin{itemize}
\item The MTE isn't a number it is a \alert{function}.
\item All of the other objects (LATE, ATE, ATT, etc.) can be written as integrals (weighted averages) of the MTE.
\item The idea is to bridge the treatment effect parameters (stuff we get from running regressions) and the structural parameters: features of $f(\beta_i)$.
\end{itemize}
\end{frame}

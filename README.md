# applied-metrics
This is a PhD level course in Applied Econometrics at NYU Stern.

The course is much more applied than my micro-metrics course (http://www.github.com/chrisconlon/micro-metrics)

In addition to traditional econometric approaches, this course draws connections to recent literature on machine learning.

The following textbooks may be useful for additional information:
- [Econometric Analysis by Bill Greene](https://www.amazon.com/Econometric-Analysis-8th-William-Greene/dp/0134461363)
- [Elements of Statistical Learning by Hastie, Tibshirani, and Friedman](https://statweb.stanford.edu/~tibs/ElemStatLearn/)
- Other lectures borrowed/stolen from various sources

These are more advanced treatments:
- [Microeconometrics by Cameron and Trivedi](https://www.amazon.com/Microeconometrics-Methods-Applications-Colin-Cameron/dp/0521848059)
- [Econometrics by Bruce Hansen](https://www.ssc.wisc.edu/~bhansen/econometrics/)

The rough outline of the course is as follows:
1. Introductory Time Series
2. Panel Data I: Fixed Effects, Random Effects, Clustering
3. Panel Data II: Dynamic Panel Data, Causal FE, Empirical Bayes
4. Nonlinear Estimation: GMM and MLE
5. Discrete Choice and Multinomial Choice
6. Bayesian Methods and MCMC
7. Treatment Effects and Potential Outcomes (Part I): Matching, Propensity Scores, LATE
8. Treatment Effects and Potential Outcomes (Part II): Difference in Difference, RDD, etc.
9. Nonparametric Methods: Kernels, KNN, Bootstrap
10. Nonparametric Methods: Kernels, KNN, Bootstrap
11. Machine Learning: Regulaarization, Model Selection, Data Reduction (Ridge, LASSO, PCA)
12. Additional Topics Based on Interest

## My Students
Over the course of the semester I expect each of my students to find at least two typos or other errors and fix them via a pull request.
